For this problem, we have  types of queries you can perform on a List:

1. Insert _y_ at index _x_:
```
Insert
x y
```
2. Delete the element at index _x_:
```
Delete
x
```

Given a list, _L_, of _N_ integers, perform _Q_  queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input
```
5
12 0 1 78 12
2
Insert
5 23
Delete
0
```

Sample Output
```
0 1 78 12 23
